# House Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a simple house price prediction model built using linear regression.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the prices of houses based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, etc. Linear regression is used as the predictive model due to its simplicity and interpretability.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing information about various houses, including features like:

- Price
- Area
- Bedrooms
- Furnished/Unfurnished
- ...

## Model Training

The model training process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Selecting relevant features and transforming them as necessary.
3. **Model Training:** Training a linear regression model using the prepared dataset.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the trained model using R2_score.
